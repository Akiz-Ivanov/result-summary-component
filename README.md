## My process

### Built with

- **React** – for component-based architecture
- **Tailwind CSS** – for utility-first styling
- **Flexbox & Grid** – for layout and responsive structure
- **Mobile-first workflow**

### What I learned

I focused on responsive layout and consistent spacing with Tailwind’s utility classes. It was a good chance to experiment with custom theme values, color layering using `hsla()`, and component reusability in React. Tailwind 4.0’s new `@theme` feature also allowed me to centralize design tokens.
